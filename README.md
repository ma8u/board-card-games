# Seeds of life
A series of problem solving board games about plants and how they can grow together.

## Getting Started
Choose one of the available themes according to your needs, read the instructions, download a copy of the game components and play. An interesting activity (especially with kids) would be to colour the game components as you like.

## Prerequisites
All you need to play the games is an A4 printer. 

## Themes
Every theme is designed for a different complexity level on the way plants can connect with each other. The available themes are described below :

+ Stone Age Edition : Placing seeds side by side based on their basic needs.

+ Food Forest : Connecting plants based on their ability to co-exist.

## Authors
Game designed by ma8u and son for the purpose of teaching about ways some plants grow well together and others do not. The scheme can be used as a template for garden planning by using real plants in every card based on their characteristics.
