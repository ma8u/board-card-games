# Seeds of life
A series of problem solving board games about plants and how they can grow together.

## Getting Started
Choose one of the available themes according to your needs, read the instructions, download a copy of the game components and play. An interesting activity (especially with kids) would be to colour the game components as you like.

## Prerequisites
All you need to play the games is an A4 printer. 

## Themes
Every theme is designed for a different complexity level on the way plants can connect with each other. The available themes are described below :

+ Stone Age Edition : Placing seeds side by side based on their 3 basic needs.

+ Full Circle : Connecting plants for yearly succession through the seasons.

+ Food Forest : Connecting plants based on their ability to co-exist.
