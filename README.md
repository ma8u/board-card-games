# Seeds of life
A series of problem solving card games about plants and how they can grow together.

## Getting Started
Choose one of the available themes, read the instructions, download a copy of the game components and play. An interesting activity (especially with kids) would be to colour the game components as you like.

## Prerequisites
All you need to play the games is an A4/A3 printer. 

## Themes
Every theme is designed for a different complexity level on the way plants can connect with each other. The available themes are described below :

+ Stone Age Edition : Placing seeds side by side based on their basic needs using Tokens with symbols.

+ Food Forest : Connecting plants based on their ability to co-exist using Cards with symbols.

## Authors
This series was developed by ma8u and son for the purpose of learning about ways some plants grow well together and others do not. The scheme can be used as a template for garden planning by using real plants in every card based on their characteristics.
