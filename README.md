# About
Apps and crafts on the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, Mathematics (S.T.E.A.M.) in the raw form.

## Getting Started
Choose one of the available games, read the instructions, download a copy of the game components and play. Extra interesting activity (especially with kids) would be to color the game components as you like.

## Prerequisites
All you need to play the games is an A4/A3 printer. 

## Gardening Series
Every theme is designed for a different complexity level on the way plants can connect with each other. The available themes are described below :

+ Seeds of Stone : Placing seeds side by side based on their basic needs using Tokens with symbols.
+ Cards of life : Connecting plants based on their ability to co-exist using Cards with symbols.

This series was developed for the purpose of learning about ways some plants grow well together and others do not. The scheme can be used as a template for garden planning by using real plants based on their characteristics.
