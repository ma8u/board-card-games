# Seeds of life
A series of problem solving card games about plants and how they can grow together.

## Getting Started
Choose one of the available themes, read the instructions, download a copy of the game components and play. An interesting activity (especially with kids) would be to colour the game components as you like.

## Prerequisites
All you need to play the games is an A4/A3 printer. 

## Themes
Every theme is designed for a different complexity level on the way plants can connect with each other. The available themes are described below :

+ Seeds of Stone : Placing seeds side by side based on their basic needs using Tokens with symbols.

+ Cards of life : Connecting plants based on their ability to co-exist using Cards with symbols.

## Final Notes
This series was developed for the purpose of learning about ways some plants grow well together and others do not. The scheme can be used as a template for garden planning by using real plants based on their characteristics.
